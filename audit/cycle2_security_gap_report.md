# Cycle 2 - Security Gap Report

## Overview
Security package review identifying structural implementation vulnerabilities vs functional gaps.

## Modifications
- Removed all `// @ts-nocheck` directives.
- Updated `packages/security/index.ts` RegExp matchers to eliminate potential ReDoS and properly encapsulate private key checks (`(?:RSA|EC|OPENSSH)` instead of `(RSA|EC|OPENSSH)`).

## Gaps & Future Backlog
1. JWT verification handles errors poorly and lacks structural typing.
2. Limited coverage of deep edge guards beyond standard web workflows.

## Status
- Typecheck: PASS
- Lint: PASS
- Build: PASS
- Test: PASS
