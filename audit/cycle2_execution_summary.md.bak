# Cycle 2 - Final Execution Summary

## Reverted
- Reverted out-of-scope `apps/web/lib/workflows.ts`, `artifacts/sbom/*` and left-over shell files.
- Removed arbitrary `as any` shortcuts used previously to silence `manifest-runtime-intelligence.test.ts`. Solved that with real explicit Type/Schema references.

## Core Tasks Completed
- Removed `// @ts-nocheck` across `apps/voice-engine`, `packages/integrations`, `packages/workflows-core`, and `packages/security`.
- **Voice-Engine:** Added explicit WebSocket protocol payload interfaces, `CallSession` session states, and unauthenticated guard loops via API. Added structured logging via `@birthub/logger`.
- **Integrations:** Standardized JSON fetches through `http.ts` introducing Idempotency Key mapping, provider labeling, and precise trace logs per integration adapter (`enotas`, `pagarme`). Removed typing casts in favor of object spreads `...(val ? { key: val } : {})`.
- **Workflows:** Rewrote `executeStep` and `executeAgentNode` handling internal try-catches and pushing boundaries out using `workflows-core:*` tagged structured logs.
- Confirmed `pnpm build` works perfectly.
- Confirmed tests (`pnpm test`) across the affected components and `agents-core` run correctly.

## Files Touched
- `apps/voice-engine/src/server.ts`
- `apps/voice-engine/src/server.test.ts`
- `packages/integrations/src/clients/http.ts`
- `packages/integrations/src/clients/fiscal.ts`
- `packages/integrations/src/clients/payments-br.ts`
- `packages/workflows-core/src/nodes/agentExecute.ts`
- `packages/workflows-core/src/nodes/executeStep.ts`
- `packages/security/index.ts`
- `packages/agents-core/src/__tests__/manifest-runtime-intelligence.test.ts`
- `audit/*`

## Global Risks
1. Voice Engine runtime lacks persistent DB states for sessions.
2. Webhooks inside `integrations` will need scaling mechanisms once API traffic spikes.
